layout: presentation

<!-- 

Use presentation as layout and use the _slides folder to create a file per slide (like it now)

OR

Use raw as layout and write the presentation as markdown in the same file with:

---
layout: raw

(I left some markdown below so there are some slides example)

-->
# First Slide

stuff

___  <!-- "___" Makes a basement slide -->

# Basement 1

Hey, you can still go down

```
test
```

___

# Basement 2

You're rock bottom!

--- <!-- "---" Makes the next slide -->

# Second slide

stuff

Note:
This will only display in the notes window.
